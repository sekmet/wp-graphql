description: Expose Advanced Custom Fields in the WPGraphQL Schema

WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields automatically exposes your ACF fields to the WPGraphQL Schema

https://www.wpgraphql.com/acf/

Note: WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields supports nearly all of the ACF (free & pro) fields. Some of the fields, such as Accordion and Tab, which are not data fields are not supported. The Clone field needs some more assessment to determine if it can properly be supported. Fields from 3rd party extensions are not supported out of the box, but we are interested in supporting the popular ones.


Alternatively, it's recommended to refer to the (/docs/api-reference/fields)[Fields API Reference]
to learn about exposing your custom fields to the Schema.
